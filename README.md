## Replication data for: Conservation Gaps in Traditional Vegetables Native to Europe and Fennoscandia 

Vegetables are rich in vitamins and other micronutrients and are important crops for heathy diets and diversification of the food system and many traditional (also termed underutilized or indigenous) species may play a role. The current study analyzed 35 species with a European region of diversity and with a specific focus on Fennoscandia. We mapped georeferenced occurrences and current genebank holdings based on global databases and conducted conservation gaps analysis based on representativeness scores *in-situ* and *ex-situ*. Out of the 35 target species, only two (carrot, *Daucus carota*, and beet, *Beta vulgaris*) got at a low priority score for further conservation initiatives, while 19 and 14 species respectively got a high or medium priority score. We identify a pattern where traditional vegetables are poorly represented in genebanks holdings. This correspond well to the lack of attention in the scientific community measured in number published papers. Considering the grand challenges ahead in terms of climate change, population growth and environmental problems, traditional vegetables deserve greater attention. At least their genetic resources should be properly conserved.
