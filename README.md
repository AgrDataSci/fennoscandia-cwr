## Replication data for: Conservation gaps in traditional vegetables native to Fennoscandia 

The aim of this study was to map distribution patterns of traditional vegetables in Fennoscandia and relate distribution to present *ex situ* conservation. A second aim was to increase the awareness of genetic resources as part of the ecosystem services. Here we show that plants growing in the forests and mountains are of global interest, as they represent genetic resources for crop improvement, agricultural diversification and future food security.
